> **`Problem Statement`** : Car pricing is a very difficult thing because there are many parameters and factors that car pricing depends on. Specifically, we want to understand the factors affecting car pricing in the Moroccan market, as these can be very different from other markets.


- 🎯 In this notebook, we will look for significant variables to predict the price of a car. and understand how much these variables describe the price of a car. Before tackling the exploratory analysis of data, creation of models..., we will collect a large set of data on the different types of cars (used and new) on the Moroccan market available on the [Automobile Wandalo Site](https://www.wandaloo.com/)
- ✔️ You can check out another detailed notebook related to car pricing that I did during the data mining course [here](https://github.com/labrijisaad/Car-Price-Prediction)
